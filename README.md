This repository consist of solutions of four **kaggle competitions** within the ODS course **mlcourse.ai**:

### 1. Catch Me If You Can 
[Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2/overview), [Solution](https://github.com/denisfin/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/A2_alice.py)

  Web-user identification is a hot research topic on the brink of sequential pattern mining and behavioral psychology.
Here we try to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether it belongs to Alice or somebody else.
The data comes from Blaise Pascal University proxy servers. Paper "A Tool for Classification of Sequential Data" by Giacomo Kahn, Yannick Loiseau and Olivier Raynaud.

### 2. How good is your Medium article?
[Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-good-is-your-medium-article/overview), [Solution](https://github.com/denisfin/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/A2_medium.py)

  In this competition your task will be to predict the number of "recommendations" for an article published on Medium.
  
### 3. Flight delays
[Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018), [Solution](https://github.com/denisfin/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/A3_flight_delays.py)

  Predict whether a flight will be delayed for more than 15 minutes.
  
### 4. Dota 2 Winner Prediction
[Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mlcourse-dota2-win-prediction), [Solution](https://github.com/denisfin/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/A4_dota2.py)

  In this competition your task is to predict the outcome of a Dota 2 game given all the game’s characteristics up to a certain point in the game. There are two teams in Dota 2 games: Radiant and Dire. You’ll need to evaluate the chances team Radiant victory. Game’s data is presented with numeric and categorical features, event logs, time series, etc. Working with game’s data and learning to see patterns and regularities can prove very useful in further work.
